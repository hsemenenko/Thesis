\section*{Statement of Work}

The photonic chips were initially conceived by Mark Thompson and Mark Godfrey. The chip mask was designed by Mark Godfrey and fabricated by Oclaro. The experiment was initially designed by Chris Erven and Philip Sibson and initial characterisation of the chips performed by Philip Sibson. I modified the initial experimental design and packaged the devices for electrical and optical testing. I performed the experiment and analysed the data with support from Philip Sibson. This chapter will expand on the work previously published in reference \cite{semenenko2019}.

\section{Introduction}

Secure communication protocols have been the focus of much academic research since the promise of quantum computing attacks against modern cryptography \cite{shor1994}. \Ac{QKD} aims to provide long-term security without assuming the computational power of an adversary \cite{BB84, E91}. However, inconsistencies between theory and experiment have raised questions in terms of real-world security, while large and power-hungry commercial systems have slowed wide-scale adoption.

\Ac{QKD} has been under scrutiny from the emerging `quantum hacking' community who have demonstrated that real-world implementations do not always meet the assumptions of the theoretical models \cite{mdi-qkd}. This can lead to malicious attacks that allow Mallory to gain information about the secret key. These include side-channels \cite{Lamas-Linares2007}, where vulnerable information is leaked through uncharacterised channels, or responses to external manipulation of devices through classical means \cite{Gisin2006}. In particular, many attacks have been directed at the detectors due to their complexity and inconsistencies between theory and experiment \cite{Lydersen2010b,Zhao2008, Makarov2006}.

\Ac{MDI} is a recent protocol that tackles some of the more prevalent attacks on systems by removing all detector side-channels \cite{mdi-qkd}. It does so by introducing a third party (Charlie) who acts as a relay to mediate detection events by announcing quantum correlations between states sent by Alice and Bob. The detection events alone do not contain any information about the secret key, so an eavesdropper cannot gain information by targeting the detectors. 

At the heart of the \Ac{MDI} protocol is \ac{HOM} interference \cite{HOM}, a quantum phenomenon where indistinguishable single photons incident on a beam splitter interfere and bunch. \ac{HOM} interference is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum optics which describes an important interaction between photons. However, interference between independent sources remains challenging due to the requirement of the photons being indistinguishable in all degrees of freedom \cite{Xu2013}. It is possible to perform \ac{HOM}-like interference using weak coherent states, albeit with a reduced visibility in coincidences. 

One of the more challenge degrees of freedom to ensure indistinguishability is the wavelength of the sources. Heterodyne detection is typically used to measure the frequency difference between two independent lasers where interference of optical fields on a beam splitter will produce a beat note when measured by a photodiode. However, photodiodes will require optical powers much greater than those used for \ac{QKD} protocols. Without drastically increasing the complexity of a system, we can instead use \ac{HOM} interference to characterise the wavelength overlap between independent sources.

%While the phenomenon itself is well understood, generating states for quantum interference at the high speeds required for modern telecommunication is practically challenging.

%However, due to the multi-photon nature of coherent states, the maximum visibility of a HOM dip is reduced to $50\%$ \cite{Rarity2005}.

%It underpins a range of quantum technologies spanning computing \cite{}, sensing \cite{} and communication \cite{}. 

Integrated quantum photonics has facilitated a drastic increase in complexity of experiments simply not possible with alternatives. The inherent phase stability is a vital resource for quantum experiments meaning integrated devices are poised to create an accessible platform. \Ac{QKD} systems have historically been bulky and expensive which has limited their practicality and has slowed their commercial adoption. Recent developments on \ac{InP} photonic integrated devices have established them as a promising platform for telecommunications \cite{smit2014}. The platform fulfils all of the requirements to perform \ac{QKD} at state-of-the-art rates \cite{Sibson2017InP}. The monolithic inclusion of laser sources provides a method of producing weak coherent states that can be used in a decoy-state QKD protocol \cite{Lo2005}. Efficient and fast phase modulation can be performed through a \ac{qcse} with a bandwidth up to \SI{40}{GHz} \cite{smit2014}. The possibility of mass production means that \ac{InP} devices are an excellent candidate to reduce the access cost of a \ac{QKD} network and allow wide adoption \cite{JeppixRoadmap}.

In this chapter, we experimentally demonstrate that \ac{InP} devices fulfil all the requirements of state-of-the-art \ac{HOM} interference while also being a practical platform for future quantum networks. Using on-chip lasers and pulse modulation, we generated \acp{wcp} and measured a visibility of \SI{46.5(8)}{\percent} between independent devices clocked at \SI{431}{MHz}. Through gain switching, we show that the same interference is possible at \SI{250}{MHz} without a reduction in state fidelity. This visibility is comparable to other demonstrations \cite{Yuan2014, Rubenok2013, Comandar2016} with the benefit of being performed with integrated devices. Crucially, this level of interference demonstrates \ac{InP} fulfil the required control for future \ac{QKD} networks.

%In this letter, we extend the application of InP devices as a QKD platform by demonstrating the required control to interfere two independent InP transmitters producing weak coherent states.  This experiment paves the way for a more practical, accessible and affordable metropolitan QKD networks.

\section{Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference}

\Ac{HOM} interference is a quantum phenomena where two indistinguishable single photons incident on a balanced beam splitter will interfere and bunch. It was first seen by Hong, Ou and Mandel in 1987 \cite{HOM} and is fundamental to many quantum information technologies from computation to communication and sensing. 

Conceptually, the experiment is simple. We first consider two single photons that are indistinguishable only in their spatial modes. Mathematically, this can be represented as 

\begin{equation}
	\hat{a}^\dagger \hat{b}^\dagger \ket{0,0}_{a,b} = \ket{1,1}_{a,b}
\end{equation}
where $a,b$ are the two spatial modes.

In general, we can consider a beam splitter to have some reflection component, $r$, and some transmission component, $t$. The transformation matrix is given as 

\begin{equation}
	\left(
	\begin{matrix}
		t & r \\
		r & t
	\end{matrix}
	\right)
	\quad\text{such that}\quad
	|r|^2 + |t|^2 = 1 
	\quad\text{and}\quad
	r^\ast t + r t^\ast = 0
\end{equation}
where $|r|^2$ and $|t|^2$ are the probabilities of reflection and transmission, respectively. The restrictions on $r$ and $t$ come from the unitary of quantum transformations. For a balance beam splitter, the transformation matrix becomes

\begin{equation}
	\text{BS}_{50:50} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
	\left(
	\begin{matrix}
		1 & 1 \\
		1 & -1
	\end{matrix}
	\right)	
\end{equation}
where the {-1} is physically represented as a relative $\pi$ phase being applied between the two reflected paths. In an operator formalism, the creation operators will transform as

\begin{equation}
	\hat{a}^\dagger \rightarrow \frac{\hat{c}^\dagger + \hat{d}^\dagger}{\sqrt{2}} \quad \text{and} \quad \hat{b}^\dagger \rightarrow \frac{\hat{c}^\dagger - \hat{d}^\dagger}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{a}$ and $\hat{b}$ are the two input modes and $\hat{c}$ and $\hat{d}$ the two output modes. Then two photons incident on a {50:50} beam splitter become

\begin{equation}
	\hat{a}^\dagger \hat{b}^\dagger \ket{0,0}_{a,b} \rightarrow \left( \frac{\hat{c}^\dagger + \hat{d}^\dagger}{\sqrt{2}} \right)  \left( \frac{\hat{c}^\dagger - \hat{d}^\dagger}{\sqrt{2}} \right)  \ket{0,0}_{c,d} = \frac{1}{2}((\hat{c}^\dagger)^2 - (\hat{d}^\dagger)^2 \ket{0,0}_{c,d}
\end{equation}

We find that after the photons have interfered there is no probability that a photon ends up in each of the output modes of the beam splitter. This is referred to as the photons bunching, creating the superposition state

\begin{equation}
	\frac{1}{2}\left(\ket{2,0}_{c,d} - \ket{0,2}_{c,d}\right)
\end{equation}

If we were to look at the detection events after the beam splitter, we would not see any coincidences in the output modes. This is a useful measure of how indistinguishable the input photons are. By deliberately introducing some distinguishability between the two photons (for example a time delay), a measure of visibility can be introduced as the ratio of coincidences with and without \ac{HOM} interference.

\subsection{Coherent States on a Beam Splitter}

While \ac{HOM} interference is typically considered when single photons interfere on a beam splitter, the same phenomenon can be seen with coherent states.  However, unlike interference with classical electric fields, we will assume that the incoming states are not phase coherent. We will see that the same reduction in coincidences can be demonstration, but with a visibility limited 50\% due to multi-photon events \cite{Rarity2005}. 

Consider two coherent states, $\ket{\alpha}$ and $\ket{\beta}$, incident on a beam splitter. Before the beam splitter, the states can be written as

\begin{align}
	\ket{\alpha} &= \text{D}(\alpha)\ket{0,0}_{a,b} = e^{\alpha a^\dagger - \alpha^\ast a}\ket{0,0}_{a,b} = e^{-\frac{|\alpha|^2}{2}} e^{-\alpha^\ast a} e^{\alpha a^\dagger}\ket{0,0}_{a,b}\\
	\ket{\beta} &= \text{D}(\beta)\ket{0,0}_{a,b} = e^{\beta b^\dagger - \beta^\ast b}\ket{0,0}_{a,b} = e^{-\frac{|\beta|^2}{2}} e^{-\beta^\ast b} e^{\beta b^\dagger}\ket{0,0}_{a,b}
\end{align}
which, before the beam splitter, can be written jointly as

\begin{equation}
	\text{D}(\alpha)\otimes\text{D}(\beta)\ket{0,0}_{a,b}
\end{equation}

%For generality, we can consider a beam splitter in terms of reflections, $r$, and transmissions, $t$, which yields the transformation matrix
%
%\begin{equation}
%	\left(
%	\begin{matrix}
%		t & r \\
%		r & t
%	\end{matrix}
%	\right)
%	\quad\text{such that}\quad
%	|r|^2 + |t|^2 = 1 
%	\quad\text{and}\quad
%	r^\ast t + r t^\ast = 0
%\end{equation}

From the beam splitter transformation above, the creation operator transformations are

\begin{equation}
	a^\dagger \rightarrow rc^\dagger + td^\dagger \quad \text{and} \quad b^\dagger \rightarrow tc^\dagger - rd^\dagger
\end{equation}
and similarly for the annihilation operators. We will consider a beam splitter with variable reflectivity so that we can see how fabrication tolerances within the beam splitter would affect the potential visibility. Applying these relations to incident coherent states, we find after the beam splitter the state becomes

\begin{align}
	\text{D}_a(\alpha)\otimes\text{D}_b(\beta)\ket{0} =&  e^{\alpha a^\dagger - \alpha^\ast a} e^{\beta b^\dagger - \beta^\ast b}\ket{0,0}_{a,b}\\
	\longrightarrow&  e^{\alpha (r c^\dagger + t d^\dagger) - \alpha^\ast (r^\ast c + t^\ast d)}e^{\beta (t c^\dagger - r d^\dagger) - \beta^\ast (t^\ast c - r^\ast d)}\ket{0,0}_{c,d}\\
	=&  e^{(\alpha r + \beta t) c^\dagger - (\alpha^\ast r^\ast + \beta^\ast t^\ast) c} e^{(\alpha t - \beta r) d^\dagger - (\alpha^\ast t^\ast - \beta^\ast r^\ast) d}\ket{0,0}_{c,d}\\
	=&  \text{D}_c(\alpha r + \beta t)\text{D}_d(\alpha t - \beta r)\ket{0,0}_{c,d}
\end{align}

For a 50:50 beam splitter, the output would become

\begin{equation}
	\text{D}_c(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\big(i\alpha + \beta\big))\text{D}_d(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\big(\alpha - i\beta\big))\ket{0,0}_{c,d}
\end{equation}

We will model the \acp{spd} as threshold detectors meaning that single photon events are not distinguishable from multi-photon events. Therefore, we will need to consider how the efficiency of detection changes with multi-photon events. Consider an \ac{spd} with efficiency of detection $\eta$, then the probability that the detector clicks, given $n$ photons were present, is

\begin{equation}
	1 - (1 - \eta)^n
\end{equation}

Then assuming that that the two detectors, $\text{Det}_c$ and $\text{Det}_d$, at the output of the beam splitter have efficiencies $\eta_c$ and $\eta_d$, respectively, the probability of a click is

\begin{align}
	\text{P}(\text{Det}_c \text{ click}) &= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{|\alpha r + \beta t|^{2n} e^{-|\alpha r + \beta t|^2}}{n!}(1-(1-\eta_c)^n)\\
	&= 1 - e^{-|\alpha r + \beta t|^2 \eta_c}
\end{align}
and equivalently,

\begin{equation}
	\text{P}(\text{Det}_d \text{ click}) = 1 - e^{-|\alpha t - \beta r|^2 \eta_d}
\end{equation}
Therefore, the probability of a coincidence click, with both coherent states overlapped on a beam splitter, is

\begin{align}
	\text{P}_\text{HOM}\text{(coincidence)} &= \text{P}(\text{Det}_c \text{ click}) \times \text{P}(\text{Det}_d \text{ click})\\
	&= \left(1 - e^{-|\alpha r + \beta t|^2 \eta_c}\right)\left(1 - e^{-|\alpha t - \beta r|^2 \eta_d}\right)
\end{align}

Here, we plot average photon numbers ranging from 1 to 5. Both states are assumed to have equal average photon number.}
	\label{fig:HOM_BS_Vis}
\end{figure}

To get a visibility for the HOM dip, we need to consider two coherent states not interfering on a beam splitter. Then the distributions after a beam splitter are the sum of the reflected and transmitted states. Therefore, the probability of coincidence is given by

%where the the averages are given by $|r\alpha|^2 + |t\beta|^2$ and $|t\alpha|^2 + |r\beta|^2$ for $c$ and $d$, respectively.

\begin{align}
	\text{P}_\text{ind}(\text{coincidence}) &= \left(1 - e^{-\eta_c(|r\alpha|^2 + |t\beta|^2)}\right)\left(1 - e^{-\eta_d(|t\alpha|^2 + |r\beta|^2)}\right)
\end{align}

We want to consider pulses that are phase randomised relative to each other. For this, we can introduce a phase into the pulse incident from channel $a$. So we substitute $\alpha \rightarrow  e^{i\theta} \alpha$. The coincidence probabilities then become

\begin{align}
	&\text{P}_\text{HOM}\text{(coincidence)} = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\left(1 - e^{-|e^{i\theta}\alpha r + \beta t|^2 \eta_c}\right)\left(1 - e^{-|e^{i\theta}\alpha t - \beta r|^2 \eta_d}\right)\text{d}\theta\\
	&\text{P}_\text{ind}(\text{coincidence}) = \left(1 - e^{-\eta_c(|r\alpha|^2 + |t\beta|^2)}\right)\left(1 - e^{-\eta_d(|t\alpha|^2 + |r\beta|^2)}\right)
\end{align}
where the visibility of the HOM dip can be calculated from the ratio of the interfering and non-interfering cases. Explicitly, this is

\begin{equation}
	\text{Visibility} = 1 - \frac{\text{P}_\text{HOM}}{\text{P}_\text{ind}}
\end{equation}

Using this equation, we can estimate the visibility of a \ac{HOM} dip given a variable reflectivity beam splitter and average photon number, as shown in figure \ref{fig:HOM_BS_Vis}. The average photon number is assumed to be the same for both incoming states. As the beam splitter becomes more reflective (or transmissive), the visibility reduces to zero as the incoming states will no longer be interfering. However, we do see that small deviations from a {50:50} beam splitter do not cause the visibility to drastically decrease. We also see that an increase in the average photon number of the states will reduce the visibility. This is due to an increase in the multi-photon terms in the coherent states.

%The effects of this will be seen in a reduced visibility. The average photon number of the pulses used will also affect the visibility as the detectors are threshold. In figure \ref{fig:HOM_BS_Vis}, the effect of varying the photon number and using an variable reflection beam splitter on the visibility of interference. By increasing the photon number during the interference, we find that the visibility decreases with an increase in multi-photon terms.

\subsection{Wavelength Dependence}

As previously mentioned, we will be using the \ac{HOM} interference as a measure of wavelength overlap of independent sources. Therefore, it will be useful to understand what this interaction will look like. The experiment will see a \ac{CW} laser intensity modulated into pulses with a Gaussian shape in time. We will assume that the linewidth is much smaller than the frequency broadening due to pulse modulation so that the electric field can be modelled as a single frequency. This is to say that the pulses will be Fourier limited. We will also assume that effects from chirp are negligible. Therefore, we can model the normalised electric field of each pulse as

\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{E}_j(t, t_p, \omega_j, \phi_j) = \sqrt{\frac{2 \sqrt{2\ln(2)}}{t_p\sqrt{\pi}}} \exp{\left(-\frac{4 \ln(2) t^2}{t_p^2}\right)} \exp{\left(i(\omega_j t + \varphi_j)\right)}
\end{equation}
where $j = a,b$ are the beam splitter inputs, $t_p$ is the \ac{FWHM} of the pulse in time (assumed the same for both inputs), $\ln(x)$ is the natural logarithm, $\omega_j$ are the frequencies and $\phi_j$ are the phases. To calculate the interaction, we can used the beam splitter relations for electric fields,

\begin{align}
	\mathcal{E}_c &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\mathcal{E}_a + \mathcal{E}_b \right)\\
	\mathcal{E}_d &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\mathcal{E}_a - \mathcal{E}_b \right)
\end{align}

By substituting the Gaussian pulses from above into the beam splitter relationships we can find the electric fields after interference. After integrating over the pulses in time, we can calculate the intensities of the output electric fields as

\begin{align}
	\mathcal{I}_c &= 1 + \exp\left(-\frac{t_p^2(\Delta\omega)^2}{32\ln(2)}\right)\cos(\Delta\phi)\\
	\mathcal{I}_d &= 1 - \exp\left(-\frac{t_p^2(\Delta\omega)^2}{32\ln(2)}\right)\cos(\Delta\phi)
\end{align}
where we introduce $\Delta\omega = \omega_a - \omega_b$ to represent the relative frequencies between the two input fields and $\Delta\phi = \phi_a - \phi_b$ for the relative phases. 

When the intensities of the fields are low the probability of coincidence is proportional to the product of the intensities averaged over the relative phase \cite{Rarity2005}. Explicitly, we want to find

\begin{equation}
	P(1,1) \propto \langle \mathcal{I}_c \mathcal{I}_d\rangle_{\Delta\phi}
\end{equation}
Multiplying the intensities calculated above and averaging $\Delta\phi$ over $2\pi$, we find

\begin{equation}
	\langle \mathcal{I}_c \mathcal{I}_d\rangle_{\Delta\phi} = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} 1 - \exp\left(-\frac{t_p^2 \Delta\omega^2}{16\ln(2)}\right)\cos(\Delta\phi)^2 d(\Delta\phi)
\end{equation} 
which gives the shape of the interference in terms of the relative frequencies of the two incoming pulses as

\begin{equation}
	P(1,1) = 1 - \frac{V}{2} \exp\left( -\frac{t_p^2(\Delta\omega)^2}{16\ln(2)} \right)
\end{equation}
where we introduce $0 \le V \le 1$ to account for any distinguishability between the pulses in degrees of freedom other than frequency. 

%the laser angular frequency is $\omega_j$ and $\varphi_j$ is the phase associated with the pulse. By taking the Fourier transform of the electric field, we can calculate the shape in frequency space as 
%\begin{equation}
%	\mathcal{E}_j^\text{in}(\omega_j) = A \exp{\left(-\frac{t^2}{2 \omega_p^2}\right)} \exp{\left(i(\omega_j t + \varphi_j)\right)}
%\end{equation}
%
%To find the overlap, we calculate the convolution of the two functions in frequency space which will be our degree of indistinguishability. The convolution is 
%\begin{equation}
%	(f \ast g)(t) = \int^{-\infty}_{\infty} f(\tau)g(t - \tau) \text{d}\tau
%\end{equation}  
%
%The two pulses from the transmitters interfere at the beam splitter. After the interference, the intensities at the output of each arm is given as
%\begin{equation}
%	I^\text{out}_{1,2} = 1 \pm \exp{\left(-\frac{1}{2}t_p^2(\Delta\omega)^2\right)}\cos(\Delta\varphi)
%\end{equation}
%where $\pm$ distinguishes between the two output modes. The relative phases of the pulses, $\Delta\varphi = \varphi_1 - \varphi_2$, is introduced to simplify the equation.
%
%We are then able to calculate the coincidence probability by using $P(1,1) \propto \langle I_1 I_2\rangle$ \cite{Rarity2005}, where an average is taken over the relative phase, $\Delta\varphi$. As the laser pulses tune in wavelength, we can model the \ac{HOM} interaction as 
%\begin{equation}
%	P(1,1) = 1 - V \exp{\left(-t_p^2(\Delta\omega)^2\right)}
%	\label{eq:gaussian}
%\end{equation}
%where the visibility, $V$, takes into account any mismatch in the degrees of freedom between the two pulses (i.e. timing, polarisation, pulse shape or photon number). In the case where the pulses were perfectly indistinguishable, we could have $V = 0.5$ as the visibility is limited due to the multi-photon terms in coherent states.
%

\subsection{Quantum Over Classical}

A natural question to ask when considering a quantum effect with electric fields is how the interference is different from classical wave interference. If we considered two coherent electric fields on a beam splitter we would see an interference in the fields and a change in the number of coincidences at the output, regardless of the intensity of the input. It could be argued that the limitation of \SI{50}{\percent} visibility is due to a misconfiguration of the experimental set up allowing a distinguishability in an unconsidered degree of freedom.

We can distinguish the quantum interference from a classical fringe by considering the intensities of the individual outputs of the beam splitter. In a classical fringe, we would expect the intensity of a single output to vary as the electric fields interfere. Therefore, to verify that the interference is due to \ac{HOM} effects, we need to show that the individual intensities are not changing with the change in coincidences. When we average over the relative phases and look at the intensity of each beam splitter output we find

\begin{equation}
	\langle \mathcal{I}_c \rangle_{\Delta\phi} = \langle \mathcal{I}_d \rangle_{\Delta\phi} = 1
\end{equation}

So changing the relative wavelengths of the input pulses does not change the output intensities. This difference is due to the phase randomised nature of the incoming light and distinguishes the interference from classic interference where the light fields would have a fixed relative phase.

%As we are using coherent states, we will need to verify that the interference we see cannot be explained using a classical interference. If we considered two electric fields that were phase coherent incident on a beam splitter we would see interference. The characteristics of the outputs would differ in two ways from the quantum, \ac{HOM} interference.
%
%Firstly, as the two electric fields became indistinguishable we would see that the fields would interfere and all of the light would exit through one output port of the beam splitter. Therefore, the coincidences in the detector would go to zero, unlike the quantum interference that is limited to \SI{50}{\percent}. However, the interference would mean that the number of counts on each detector would change. So to verify that the interference is not classical, we need to ensure that the counts on each detector remain constant, while the number of coincident clicks reduces.

\section{Sources and Requirements}
\label{sec:sources}

In this section, we will discuss the main experimental challenges in performing \ac{HOM} interference and describe some of the photons sources that can be used to fulfil the stringent requirements of high-visibility interference. To show good interference between light fields, they need to be indistinguishable. Put more explicitly, for maximal interference, the two pulses need to have the same wavelength; arrive at the same time; have equal intensities; be in the same polarisation; and have the same pulse shape.

%It is well understood that for two light pulses to interfere, they need to be indistinguishable \cite{}. 

\subsection{Single Photons}

Historically, \acl{HOM} interference experiments have been performed with a single photons. The first demonstrations used \ac{spdc} to generate pairs of single photons that were distinguishable only in path \cite{HOM, Rarity1989}. By delaying one of the photons before interfering on a beam splitter, \ac{HOM} interference could be demonstrated. Subsequent experiments have demonstrated interference between single photons sources from \ac{sfwm} \cite{jiang2015}, atomic systems \cite{Leong2015}, quantum dots \cite{somaschi2016} and NV centres \cite{Bernien2012}.

% \footnote{A recent review can be found at \url{http://www.rri.res.in/quic/resources/opn2019}}.

While there have been many advances in single-photon sources through increased rates and coherence, they remain probabilistic. State-of-the-art rates are currently limited to tens of MHz \cite{chen2018} meaning they are impractical for modern communication protocols. Therefore, it is hard to claim that in their current form they will make good candidates for scalable quantum technologies without requiring multiplexing and feed-forward techniques. Each of which introduces their own set of practical challenges. 

It is worth noting that as quantum networks evolve from simple key exchange networks it will be necessary to develop single-photon sources \cite{wehner2018}. As such developments occur, they will impact the field of \ac{QKD} which would benefit from on-demand, single-photon sources provided that they fulfil the rate and loss requirements of modern communication networks. 

%It could even be conceived that these sources would impact how we communicate our classical information \cite{}

\subsection{Weak Coherent States}

In the absence of true single photon sources, another source of light needs to be considered for scalable quantum encryption protocols. Coherent states represent a close approximation to single photons when strongly attenuated. They are also readily available and easily manipulated. In the regime of low average photon number, we will introduce the term \acp{wcs}. 

As previously mentioned, the requirements for high-fidelity \ac{HOM}, and therefore \ac{QKD}, are stringent. Here we discuss some of the requirements for a \ac{wcs} sources to be useful in a \ac{QKD} system. 

\subsubsection*{Extinction Ratio}

While not necessarily required for \ac{HOM} interference, for use in a \ac{QKD} protocol the quantum states will need to exhibit low encoding errors. The extinction ratio will be the ratio of the optical powers between the logical $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$ states. In a time-bin encoding scheme, this means that there should be a high extinction ratio between the \textit{on} and \textit{off} states of the photon source allowing early and late time-bins to be well defined. A \SI{20}{dB} extinction ratio between time-bins will result in a \SI{1}{\percent} error rate in the timing information.

%The states will need to be temporally modulated to create time-bins that determine coincidence windows. While this is not , it will be important to use these states to encode quantum states for communication purposes. It will also help synchronise the two transmitters in time so coincidences can be found more easily. As we will be working with single photons states, it is important that there is a good distinction between \textit{on} and \textit{off} which we will call the extinction ratio. 

\subsubsection*{Timing Jitter}

In order to keep up with high-speed data rates of modern networks, we will need to have clock speeds that are comparable to classical devices. Therefore, it is important that we have a low timing jitter on the states to ensure the quantum states can be encoded in short time-bins. As we move towards GHz clock speeds, timing jitter on the order of picoseconds will be required.

\subsubsection*{Coherence}

In a time-bin encoding scheme, we will need to make sure that the laser pulses in the early and late time-bins maintain coherence. This will allow us to faithfully encode phase between the time-bins giving a complete encoding scheme. Physically, this means that the coherence of the laser should be much longer than the separation of the time-bins. For a \SI{1}{GHz} clocked system, we would need coherence longer than \SI{2}{\ns} meaning a linewidth of less than \SI{150}{MHz}.

%For interference, we need to be sure that the state that arrives is the same as what was sent. Therefore, the coherence of the laser used needs to have a good coherence length, which means a narrow line width. We also need to ensure that the coherence between the time-bins is maintained within a state.

\subsubsection*{Phase Randomisation}

A vital part of the \ac{HOM} interference is for the \acp{wcs} to be phase randomised. This means that each quantum state should have a phase reference that is uncorrelated to the previous state. This phase randomisation is also, crucially, what distinguishes between the classical wave interference and the quantum \ac{HOM} interference.

%While it may seem counter-intuitive to require phase randomisation after also requiring long coherence lengths of the laser. However, phase randomisation between subsequent states is a vital part of \ac{HOM} interference with coherent states. Crucially, it is what 

\subsubsection*{Linearly Polarised}

As mentioned before, the states will need to be overlapped in each degree of freedom. The polarisation needs to be linear for interference. While a \ac{pbs} can be used to ensure polarisation overlap for interference, this adds complexity and losses to the system. Orthogonal polarisations can also introduce side-channels into a \ac{QKD} system to allow Eve to gain knowledge of the key exchange.

\subsubsection*{Wavelength Tunable}

Modern telecommunications networks heavily rely on \acp{wdm} to maintain the data rates required. To ensure quantum compatibility with the same networks, it is likely that the wavelength of a \ac{QKD} system will need to be tunable in order to switch between the standardised frequency bands. This may also restrict the use of wavelength filters, unless they are easily tunable. Moreover, unfiltered wavelengths can introduce side-channels which could be exploited by Eve or Mallory.

\subsection{Previous Methods}

Several methods have been used to generate \acp{wcp} for \ac{QKD} systems. Here we briefly discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each.

\subsubsection*{Gain switched lasers}

While gain switched lasers offer simplicity and easily satisfy the phase randomisation constraint, they can suffer from bad timing jitter from the spontaneous emission and have broad spectra which require filtering \cite{Agnesi2019}.

%(filter required and timing jitter problems, limitation on speed from laser relaxation)

\subsubsection*{Laser seeding}

Laser seeding using two separately controlled laser, a master and a slave \cite{Comandar2016PLS}. The control is through multi-level RF electronics which can increase the cost of a system and, again, wavelength filtering is required.

%(Multi-level and expensive control required, filtering required)

\subsubsection*{Intensity modulation}

Starting from a \ac{CW} laser, the light can be intensity modulated into distinct time bins. There is no inherent phase randomisation involve, however, this doesn't broaden the spectrum beyond the Fourier limit meaning wavelength filtering is not required \cite{Sibson2017InP}.

\section{Integrated Weak Coherent Source}

	\label{fig:hom_chip}
\end{figure}

In this section, we will describe the integrated transmitters that we will use for generating weak coherent states. Each transmitter is \ac{InP} device, measuring \SI{6x2}{mm}, that was fabricated by Oclaro. A schematic is shown in figure \ref{fig:hom_chip} showing the on-chip laser source and \ac{mzi}.

\subsection{Laser Source}

\begin{figure}[tp]

	\caption[Microscope image of the waveguide integrated Fabry-P\'{e}rot laser]{Waveguide integrated Fabry-P\'{e}rot laser formed of two tunable \acp{DBR}, which forms the optical cavity, and an \ac{SOA} for optical gain. Gold pads allow wirebonding for electrical control through current injection. Each \ac{DBR} is \SI{200}{\um} long while the \ac{SOA} is \SI{500}{\um} for a total length of \SI{1}{\mm} including isolation sections.}
	\label{fig:InP_laser}
\end{figure}

As described in chapter \ref{chap:background}, a huge benefit for III-V materials such as \ac{InP} over silicon is the ability to monolithically integrate lasers into devices. This makes the platform particularly suited for telecommunications and generating weak coherent states for \ac{QKD}. 

%The requirements for quantum communications are somewhat more stringent than that of classical communications. To this end, we need to verify the quality of the light sources to ensure that they will be able to perform high visibility interference. 

Each device contains a Fabry-P\'{e}rot \ac{CW} laser which is shown in figure \ref{fig:InP_laser}. The \SI{1}{mm} long cavity is made from two \acp{DBR} gratings which are tunable through current injection and allow a wavelength tuning of around \SI{10}{nm}. The \ac{DBR} gratings themselves are periodic structures of differing refractive index. The peak reflected wavelength ($\lambda_\text{DBR}$) is dependent on the grating pitch ($\Lambda$) and effective refractive index ($n_\text{eff}$) of the waveguide and is given by

\begin{equation}
	\lambda_\text{DBR} = 2\Lambda n_\text{eff}
\end{equation}

From this, we find that changes in the refractive index will linearly change the reflection peak. The grating pitch is chosen to be \SI{237.7}{nm} giving a peak reflected wavelength of \SI{1550}{nm}, where $n_\text{eff} = 3.26$.

	\caption[Lasing current threshold and voltage]{Characteristics of the on-chip laser. We find a lasing current threshold of around \SI{14}{mA} and diode voltage of \SI{0.7}{V}. The power given includes losses from optical components and fibre coupling so the on-chip power would be higher.}
	\label{fig:las_curr_volt}
\end{figure}

From the picture, we can see that the \acp{DBR} are both the same length. Typically, the rear \ac{DBR} would be longer to increase the reflectivity back into the cavity which increases the laser power. While the applications here only require weak coherent states, \ac{cvqkd} requires a bright local oscillator which needs to be considered during chip design. Subsequent chip designs should considering this design change.

The \ac{SOA} is a single-mode, ridge waveguide structure that is optimised for TE polarisation. An electrical current is used to pump the carriers for a population inversion. Figure \ref{fig:las_curr_volt} shows the characteristics of the laser showing a threshold current of \SI{14}{\mA} and a diode voltage around \SI{0.7}{V}. The optical power is shown to be linear with applied laser current after the threshold and the diodes were tested up to \SI{80}{\mA}. Operating the laser at higher currents (more than around \SI{60}{\mA}) can have detrimental effects on the lasing stability as heating within the cavity can cause the laser to mode-hop. Operating the laser at lower currents resolves this issue.

%The laser was tested with up to \SI{80}{\mA} which was limited by the current source.

	\caption[On-chip laser spectra]{Typical spectra of the two independent on-chip lasers. Each demonstrates a \ac{FWHM} of \SI{30}{pm} (limited to the precision of the \ac{OSA}) and a sideband suppression of \SI{50}{dB}. The two lasers were deliberately detuned in wavelength so both spectra could be seen.}
	\label{fig:spectra}
\end{figure}

A typical spectra of the two transmitter lasers is shown in figure \ref{fig:spectra} which demonstrates a \SI{<30}{pm} \ac{FWHM} and a \SI{>50}{dB} sideband suppression. The linewidth here is stated as \SI{<30}{pm} \ac{FWHM} as this is limited to the precision of the \ac{OSA} used (Anritsu MS9740A). The two lasers were deliberately offset in wavelength and the spectra show the reproducibility offered by integrated optics. Typically, we would expect the linewidth of a Fabry-P\'{e}rot laser to be Lorentzian \cite{Ismail16}. 

While the spectrum is limited by the precision of the \ac{OSA}, we can put bounds on the linewidth from coherent measurements. The coherence length of the laser can be calculated from the linewidth by

\begin{equation}
	L_\text{coh} = \frac{c}{\pi\Delta v}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta v$ is the \ac{FWHM} of the laser in frequency. The integrated lasers from Oclaro have previously demonstrated a coherence time of \SI{1.5}{ns} which corresponds to a \ac{FWHM} of \SI{1.7}{pm} \cite{Sibson2017InP}. We will see later that partial coherence can be seen at \SI{4}{ns} which provides a lower bound on the \ac{FWHM} of around \SI{0.7}{pm}. In order to measure the the linewidth more accurately, a self-heterodyne measurement technique can be used \cite{self-heterodyne}. 

In figure \ref{fig:DBR_sweep}, we show laser tuning through current injection of the \acp{DBR} which will change the reflection peak through heating effects. By varying the voltage from \SI{0}{\V} to \SI{1}{\V}, the wavelength can be tuned by about \SI{10}{\nm} within the telecommunications C-band. Both the front and rear \acp{DBR} need to have similar voltages applied to maintain a good cavity mode for lasing. The wavelength can also be tuned by changing the temperature of the device, which causes the cavity to expand or contract. 

\begin{figure}[tp]

	\import{chapters/chapter03/fig03/}{DBR_sweep.pdf_tex}

\end{figure}

	\caption[Laser wavelength current-injection sweep]{By changing the driving current of the on-chip laser, we can change the wavelength through heating and carrier effects. This will also vary the power. As the laser current source can be varied in steps of \SI{10}{\uA}, we can see that the control of the laser wavelength through this effect can be very precise.}
	\label{fig:curr_sweep}
\end{figure}

The wavelength of the lasers can also be finely tuned through current injection of the \ac{SOA} itself. This is shown in figure \ref{fig:curr_sweep} where changing the driving current from \SIrange{20}{28}{mA} sees an increase in wavelength of around \SI{100}{pm} due to heating effects in the cavity. Also with with a wavelength change, this will also change the intensity of the laser. As we saw above, the photon number is an important aspect to control during a \ac{HOM} interference. Therefore, when using \ac{SOA} current injection to sweep the wavelength some attenuation will also be required. 

We note here that the narrow linewidth of the laser means that during no experiment with the \ac{InP} chips do we need to use a wavelength filter to clean up the light or optical pulses. This is important as it removed a component that would add cost to any system but also restrict the wavelength operation of the devices. Without the need for a filter, the lasers are free to operate in a wavelength that spans more than \SI{10}{nm}. This will be crucial as it is likely that \ac{QKD} systems will needed to be \ac{wdm} to meet the demands of high-speed networks for increased rates or quantum-classical multiplexing.

\subsection{Phase Modulation}

To create weak coherent states, we will use two different types of phase modulation for good extinction \acp{wcp} at high-speed. 

\subsubsection{Electro-Optic Phase Modulation}

The main modulation effect that we will use is the \ac{qcse} which has operating speeds of more than \SI{40}{GHz} \cite{qcse, smit2014}. The waveguide contains a \ac{mqw} structure which has a variable absorption that is dependent on the electric field applied over the waveguide. The refractive index change due to this absorption can be calculated through the Kramers-Kronig relation between the real and imaginary parts. Given a complex function of the form $\chi(\omega) = \chi_1(\omega) + i \chi_2(\omega)$ we have that

\begin{equation}
	\chi_1(\omega) = \frac{1}{\pi} \mathcal{P} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\chi_2(\omega')}{\omega' - \omega} d\omega'
\end{equation}
where Cauchy principle value is denoted by $\mathcal{P}$. From this, the refractive index, $n$, is related to the absorption coefficient, $\alpha$, by \cite{Hutchings1992}

\begin{equation}
	n(\omega) - 1 \approx \frac{c}{\pi}\mathcal{P}\int_0^\infty \frac{\alpha(\omega')}{(\omega')^2 - \omega^2} d\omega'
\end{equation}

As we are only interested here in the refractive index change due to the \ac{qcse}, we will neglect all other electo-optic effects. We will also assume that the changes in the absorption are localised within a small region \cite{weiner1987}. Therefore, we can rewrite the refractive index as $n(\omega) = n_0(\omega) + \Delta n (\omega)$ and similarly for the absorption coefficient. Within the frequency range $\omega_1 < \omega < \omega_2$ and assuming that $\Delta \alpha \ne 0$, we find the change in refractive index to be

\begin{equation}
	\Delta n(\omega) \approx \frac{c}{\pi}\mathcal{P}\int_{\omega_1}^{\omega_2} \frac{\alpha(\omega')}{(\omega')^2 - \omega^2} d\omega'
\end{equation}

By comparing the absorption of the material with and without the electric field $\alpha(\omega)$ can be estimated. Numerical integration can then be used to calculate the refractive index change due to an applied electric field. For small refractive index changes

\begin{equation}
	\Delta n \propto E^2
\end{equation}
where $E$ is the applied electric field \cite{qcse}. As the electric field increases, the effect saturates meaning that quadratic nature is only valid for small changes in the refractive index. Exactly how the electric field and the refractive index are proportional is related to the exciton peak which is dependent on the specific material. 

The modulators are oriented parallel to the major flat axis of the substrate so that linear electro-optic effects add to the \ac{qcse}, where they would substrate if placed orthogonally. While the effect from the \ac{qcse} can reach speeds in excess of \SI{40}{GHz}, design of the modulator and device packaging are important to maximise performance. For speeds above \SI{10}{GHz}, the modulator should be less than \SI{1}{mm}. To ensure faithly transfer of RF signals to the chip, wirebond length should be minimised and effective termination employed to stop reflections.

	\label{fig:InP_MZI}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Mach-Zehnder Interferometer}

As we will be operating the chip laser in \ac{CW} mode, we need to modulate the intensity of the light to create well defined time-bins for our \acp{wcs}. Using \acp{eopm} as described above, together with \acp{mmi}, we can create a \ac{mzi} with modulation speeds in excess of \SI{10}{GHz}. A microscope image of the integrated \ac{mzi} is shown in figure \ref{fig:InP_MZI}.

The structure is only \SI{1}{mm} in length, while the modulators themselves are around \SI{500}{\um} to ensure modulation speeds of more than \SI{10}{GHz}. \Acp{mmi} are used as integrated {50:50} beam splitters to split the light between the top ($\Phi_1$) and bottom ($\Phi_2$) \acp{eopm}. Unlike directional couplers which exhibit a drastic wavelength dependent splitting ratio, \acp{mmi} are used to ensure a good splitting for a wide range of wavelengths. Bond pads are used for electrical connection to the modulators to provide bias voltages and currents.

\subsubsection{Thermo-Optic Phase Modulation}

\begin{figure}[tp]
	\centering
	\small
	\def\svgwidth{0.8\textwidth} 
	\import{chapters/chapter03/fig03/Chip_heating_minimisation/}{MZI_heating_on_off_bias_sweep_phi2=2V.pdf_tex}
	\caption[MZI optimisation through thermo-optic modulation]{Due to fabrication tolerances, the phase differences between the two arms of an \ac{mzi} will be different. By using a small resistance in the modulator, we can pass a current over the modulator to tune the arms to have the same phase and increase the possible extinction ratio.}
	\label{fig:mzi_heating}
\end{figure}

Imperfections in the \acp{mzi} due to the fabrication of the devices mean that the phases accumulated on top and bottom path are not the same. While not designed for thermo-optic modulation, the \acp{eopm} have a resistance of around \SI{10}{\ohm} which can be used to vary the phase. By passing a small current over one arm of the \ac{mzi}, we can correct for the phase mismatch to recover the desired performance.

Figure \ref{fig:mzi_heating} demonstrates how heating effects can change the characteristics of an \ac{mzi}. By changing the voltage bias for the \ac{qcse} over one arm of the modulator ($\Phi_1$) whilst the other arm is kept constant ($\Phi_2$) we can characterise the performance. $\Phi_1$ is swept over the range \SIrange{0}{-10}{V} and the power at one output of the \ac{mzi} is measured. We can then compare the difference in DC modulation with and without heating. 

Without heating, the absorption effects mean that the extinction ratio possible are reduced to only around \SI{15}{dB}. However, by correcting for the phase difference in the two arms, the extinction ratio can be increase to around \SI{30}{dB} with voltage swing of around \SI{3}{\Vpp}. 

Using this heating technique, we can apply RF modulation to the \ac{mzi} to create \acp{wcp}, as shown in figure \ref{fig:pulses}. Without correcting for detector and timing electronic timing uncertainty, the \ac{FWHM} is \SI{175}{ps}. We also find an extinction ratio of more than \SI{20}{dB} with only \SI{2}{\Vpp} swing.

We find an extinction ratio of just over \SI{20}{dB} and a \ac{FWHM} of \SI{175}{\ps}. The histogram is not corrected for detector or time-tagging jitter so the \ac{FWHM} includes these uncertainties. The slope after the pulse is attributed to the initial signal shape from the signal generator, the impedance matching on the PCB and reflections from the RF termination.}
	\label{fig:pulses}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Fibre Coupling}

To efficiently couple the light from the waveguide mode (\SI{1.5}{\um}) to a fibre model (\SI{10}{\micro\metre}), a spot-size converter on the chip is used to expand the light mode to \SI{3}{\micro\meter}. The spot-size converter also changes the mode to be more circular from the elliptical waveguide mode. A lensed fibre was then used to convert this mode to \SI{10}{\micro\meter}. The fibre was held in a Elliot Gold fibre launch stage with piezo actuators that gave a precision of \SI{10}{\nm} in X, Y and Z axes over a range of \SI{25}{\micro\meter}.

To reduce reflections back into the waveguide, the facet of the spot-size converter is at an angle relative to the edge of the chip. On these devices, the waveguides are at \SI{7}{\degree} to the edge which minimises back scattering. From Snell's law, given that the waveguide refractive index is 3.26, we can calculate that the fibre should be at \SI{23}{\degree} to the edge of the chip.

It was not possible to directly measure the coupling losses on these devices as there were no test structures to isolate the waveguides and spot-size converters. From foundry tests, the coupling loss from a spot-size converter to a standard single-mode fibre was estimated to be \SI{1.5}{dB}. It is expect that these devices will have similar losses.

\subsection{Packaging}

\begin{figure}[tp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Chip_PCB}
	\caption[Transmitter PCB package]{Chip packaging to breakout the electrical connection on the chip. SMA connectors were used for the high-speed connections to offer a response of more than \SI{10}{\GHz}. Capacitors and resistors were also used for termination of RF modulation signals. DC pins were used for low-speed connections for thermo-optic modulation and \ac{DBR} tuning. The bottom of the PCB cut out to allow optical access to the side of the chip.}
	\label{fig:chip_pcb}
\end{figure}

To be able to access the electrical components of the integrated devices, we need to create a package to transfer the signals from the driving electronics to the chip . A PCB was designed to electrically connect the modulators and laser to SMA connectors for high-speed operation and DC pins for biasing. A render is shown in figure \ref{fig:chip_pcb}. The bottom of the chip is ground which connects to a copper block that is also connected to the ground of the PCB. Silver epoxy was used to glue the chip to the mount to ensure a good electrical connection. It also provided a good thermal connection for temperature stabilisation. The PCB is designed with a cut-out for optical access to the chip from one side.

\begin{figure}[tp]

	\label{fig:GSG_waveguide}
\end{figure}

In order to maintain a good signal integrity the impedance of the tracks needs to match the electronics. As the devices require a number of RF connections to a small area, using standard FR-4 material would not be sufficient. Instead, Rogers 6006ns material was chosen for its high dielectric constant of \num{6.15} meaning that narrow grounded coplanar waveguides with could still maintain \SI{50}{\ohm} impedance. A schematic of the waveguides is shown in figure \ref{fig:GSG_waveguide}. The characteristic impedance of a grounded coplanar waveguide can be approximated by \cite{wadell1991}

\begin{equation}
	Z_0 = \frac{60\pi}{\sqrt{E_\text{eff}}}\frac{1}{\frac{K(k)}{K(k')} + \frac{K(k_l)}{K(k_l')}}
\end{equation}
where, for a track of width $a$, waveguide of width $b$ and substrate of height $h$ we have

\begin{align}
	k &= \frac{a}{b} &&k' = \sqrt{1 - k^2}\\
	k_l &= \frac{\tanh\left(\frac{\pi a}{4 h}\right)}{\tanh\left(\frac{\pi b}{4 h}\right)} &&k_l' = \sqrt{1 - k_l^2}
\end{align}

\begin{equation}
	E_\text{eff} = \frac{1 + E_r \frac{K(k')}{K(k)} \frac{K(k_l)}{K(k_l')}}{1 + \frac{K(k')}{K(k)} \frac{K(k_l)}{K(k_l')}}
\end{equation}
where $K(k)$ is the elliptic integral of the first kind. 

The thickness of the substrate used was \SI{250}{\um} so a track of width \SI{260}{\um} with a spacing of \SI{100}{\um} (giving a total waveguide width of \SI{460}{\um}) has a characteristic impedance of \SI{50}{\ohm}. Ideally, to avoid microstrip line modes the design should have $h \gg b$ and the ground plane should extend away from the waveguide more than $b$\cite{riaziat1987}. In this design, these restrictions will be relaxed due to space constraints. However, through operation we will see that the waveguide can support a modulation bandwidth up to \SI{10}{GHz}.

The tracks were designed and then laser etched into the copper on the substrate. The PCB was given a gold coating using electroplating to avoid oxidation of the copper and to help with gold wirebonding. In future iterations, a nickel layer should be applied before the gold to avoid gold diffusing into the copper. SMA, DC pins, capacitors and resistors were then soldered onto the PCB using a low temperature solder paste.

The pads on the chip were wirebonded to the PCB with a \SI{25}{\micro\meter} ball bond and then a wedgebond onto the PCB. Silver epoxy was then applied over the wedgebond to ensure a good electrical contact with the PCB and to increase durability. The PCB was designed such that the length of the RF wirebonds was minimised so that capacitance and resistance of the gold wire were reduced. Such effects can be detrimental for high-speed operation.

An RF signal could be applied to one side of a \ac{eopm} while the other side provided termination to minimise electrical reflections. A capacitor blocked the DC component of the signal while a \SI{50}{\ohm} resistor terminates the AC signal. 

\section{Fibre Optic Transmitter}

For initial demonstrations of the on-chip laser and pulses generation, it will be useful to have a well characterised source of \acp{wcp}. Here, we describe the commercial fibre components that can be used to replicate the chip components.

\subsection{State Preparation}

A \ac{CW} fibre laser (Yenista T100s-hp) with a wide tuning around the C-band in steps of \SI{1}{\pm} was used as the source. This meant that the laser could be sweep very precisely compared with the integrated laser, which would remain fixed. 

The lithium niobate fibre modulator from ThorLabs was used to intensity modulate the light. It required a \SI{5}{\Vpp} pulse meaning that amplification of the signal from the \ac{ppg} was needed. The amplifier used was an SHF 810 with \SI{29}{dB} gain and up to \SI{40}{\GHz} operation.

The time-bandwidth product of a Gaussian pulse is
\begin{equation}
	\Delta \omega = \frac{4 \ln(2)}{\tau_p}
\end{equation}
where $\tau_p$ is the \ac{FWHM} of the pulse in time and $\Delta \omega$ is the angular frequency \ac{FWHM}. For a pulse width of $\tau_p = \SI{100}{ps}$ the minimum spectral width of a Gaussian pulse is \SI{4}{GHz}. The typical linewidth of the fibre laser was \SI{<400}{KHz} so it is a good approximation to assume that any \acp{wcp} will be transform limited as the contribution from pulsing is much larger than the linewidth.

\section{Measurement}

%The pulses are coupled into fibre allowing the rest of the experiment to make use of fibre components. 

%In order to vary the pulse intensity, each transmitter has a digital \acp{voa}. These can be used to ensure a good match in powers between the two transmitters.

As the pulses were coupled it fibre, we could make use of commercial fibre components for control, interference and measurement. This section will describe the required control off chip, as well as the detection 

\subsection{Polarisation and Projection}

Fibre polarisation controllers are used to rotate the polarisation of the pulses and a \ac{pbs} gives a known polarisation in a polarisation maintaining fibre. A polarisation-maintaining {50:50} beam splitter is used for the interference to ensure that both transmitters are overlapped in polarisation.

\subsection{Photon Number Feedback}

As we will be using the current of the on-chip laser to vary the wavelength this will also change the power. To ensure maximal interference, both transmitters should have an equal photon number. Using the sum total counts of the detectors, a feedback loop was used to ensure that both transmitters (fibre or chip-based) remained constant in photon number. Each transmitter used a digital \ac{voa} (Oz Optics DA100) to vary the power with \SI{0.01}{dB} precision.

\subsection{Detection}

The detectors used in the experiment were \acp{snspd} from Photonspot which were chosen over other single-photon detectors for their high efficiency (\SI{>80}{\percent}), small timing jitter (\SI{30}{\ps}) and short recovery time (\SI{100}{\ns}). The detectors were housed in a closed cycle helium refrigerator that was kept at \SI{0.7}{K}. A successful event was indicated by an RF signal of around \SI{10}{\mV} which was amplified with low-noise amplifier to around \SI{200}{\mV} which could then be time-tagged.

\subsection{Time-tagging}

Detection events were time-tagged using a PicoQuant Hydraharp 400 and saved to a computer for later analysis. An optical link was used to provide a synchronisation signal from the transmitters to the time-tagger. The precision of timing events could be set by the user and could be as low as \SI{1}{\ps} and the electronic jitter is \SI{<12}{\ps}. The dead time of the tagging electronics is \SI{<80}{\ns}, which is comparable to the detector dead time so should not impact the experiment. In this experiment, \SI{16}{\ps} bins were used. As the exact series of events could be reconstructed form the time-tags, the number of coincidences could be calculated from the saved tags provided the timing information between transmitters had been calibrated.

The coincidence window could be varied to in the analysis after to ensure that the coincidences come from when the pulse is a Gaussian shape. As we see from figure \ref{fig:pulses}, there is a `tail' on the later edge of the pulses would cause a chirp in the pulse. This would have two effects on the \ac{HOM} interference. Firstly, if the two pulse shapes are different, this would cause a reduced interference as the photons would have different wavelengths. Secondly, this would change the shape of the \ac{HOM} dip from the Gaussian shape that will be derived later.

\subsection{Synchronisation}

As the \ac{HOM} interference is dependant on the time of arrival of the two pulses, we need to ensure that the pulses arrive at the beam splitter at the same time. It is also crucial that we can reconstruct the events using the timing electronics, meaning that we require to fully calibrate the optical and electrical delays. This meant that the pulses that deemed to match in the time-tagging electronics were actually those that interfered at the beam splitter. 

By making the assumption that the total delay (optical and electronic) between the two arms of the measurement system after the beam splitter was less than \SI{50}{\ns}. This was reasonable as \SI{50}{\ns} in fibre equates to about \SI{12}{\m}, and is similar in the coaxial RF cables. Then the pulse generation could be slowed to send a pulse at less than \SI{10}{\MHz} so that the pulse separation was more than \SI{100}{\ns} and the pulses could be matched to the nearest coincident event. The delay between the arms of the measurement in this experiment were found to be less than \SI{10}{\ns} which was verified through the \ac{HOM} interference.

To keep the transmitter electronics in sync with the detection electronics, an optical signal was sent over a separate fibre which acted as a reference clock. 

\section{Control Electronics}

%In order to the drive the devices, various electronic control is required. 

% In lieu of a negative voltage source, a positive voltage source was used to raise the chip ground to \SI{10}{\V} relative to the other sources. The potential over modulators could then be applied using one of the other positive voltage sources.

A multi-channel DC voltage source was used to create a voltage potential over the \acp{eopm} for the \ac{qcse}. Each modulator could be controlled separately up to a maximum bias of \SI{10}{V}. The DC biases were mixed with the RF signals using bias-tees (Mini-Circuits zx85-12g-s+) with a bandwidth up to \SI{12}{GHz}. 

To generate the RF signals, a \ac{ppg} (Keysight 81134A) was used which had a maximum output voltage swing of \SI{2}{\Vpp}. A \ac{ppg} was used over a more general arbitrary waveform generator as only two levels were required for operation of the device for this test. The minimum pulse width that could be set was \SI{100}{\ps} which when measured on an oscilloscope (Keysight DSA91304A) were around \SI{120}{\ps} \ac{FWHM}. The maximum speed of the \ac{ppg} was \SI{3.35}{\GHz} which could be controlled and dividers also used to vary the frequency of the pulses. 

A separate voltage source was used to pass a small current over one side of the \ac{mzi} to achieve thermo-optic phase modulation. The voltage could be set with a precision of \SI{1}{\mV} with typically \SIrange{200}{700}{\mV} being required for modulation. These values depended heavily on the fabrication of the device as well as different resistances from packaging.

A 10K thermistor place in the copper mount was used to give feedback to a PID loop controlled by an Arroyo 6601 and a peltier under the chip mount stabilised the temperature. The temperature is maintained around \SI{25}{\celsius} with an instability of less than \SI{0.01}{\celsius}.

	\label{fig:fibre_chip_exp}
\end{figure}

To simplify the first tests of the integrated devices, a transmitter was setup using a fibre laser and lithium niobate intensity modulators so that \ac{HOM} interference could be demonstrated with a tested source. The on-chip laser was also intensity modulated using a separate fibre modulator. A schematic of the experiment is shown in figure \ref{fig:fibre_chip_exp}. This setup would let us isolate the chip laser to characterise the interference using commercial components.

%\subsection{State Preparation}

%A \ac{CW} fibre laser was used (Yenista T100s-hp) with a wide tuning around the C-band in steps of \SI{1}{\pm}. This meant that the laser could be sweep very precisely compared with the integrated laser, which would remain fixed.

%The lithium niobate modulator was from ThorLabs and required a \SI{5}{\Vpp} pulse meaning that amplification of the signal from the \ac{ppg} was needed. The amplifier used was an SHF 810 with \SI{29}{dB} gain and up to \SI{40}{\GHz} operation. 

%By using commercial systems, this would allow us to characterise the performance of the on-chip laser and state preparation with a known source.

\subsection{Fibre Laser Wavelength Sweep}

\begin{figure}[tp]

The pulses were interfered on a beam splitter to show good interference close to the maximum visibility of \SI{50}{\percent}. The total counts remain constant through the sweep showing that the coincidence dip is not explain through classical interference.}
	\label{fig:fibre_wavelength_sweep}
\end{figure}

%Using this setup, we could independently check that the pulse generation on-chip provided the right level of control to interfere with the fibre state preparation. Again, this was to isolate the chip to find the operating conditions using known and well characterised commercial components.

%Both the fibre and on-chip lasers were modulated into \acp{wcp} using commercial lithium niobate modulators to isolate the operation of the on-chip laser. 

%Initially, the fibre laser wavelength was the chosen degree of freedom to isolate the on-chip laser as much as possible. This information would then allow us to tune the on-chip laser in wavelength to demonstrate that it had the required control and precision for chip-to-chip interference. 

The initial tests of the system used the wavelength tunability of the fibre laser as the variable degree of freedom while the on-chip laser remained fixed in wavelength and power. This first demonstration would show that the integrated laser source would have a long enough coherence over the \SI{100}{ps} pulse to interfere. This would also provide information about the precision required from tunability of the on-chip laser. 

Wavelengths of the individual lasers was coarsely overlapped on an \ac{OSA} around which the fibre laser could be tuned to measure coincidences. The timing of the pulses was controlled with electrical delays in the \acp{ppg} and a histogram used to overlap them with picosecond resolution. For this experiment the system clock was set to \SI{1.72}{\GHz}. A pulse was sent ever 4 clock cycles for a state repetition rate of \SI{431}{\MHz}. Polarisation controllers and \acp{pbs} ensured both transmitters were in the same polarisation mode before interference.

In figure \ref{fig:fibre_wavelength_sweep}, we show the single and coincidences events as the fibre laser is swept in \SI{1}{pm} steps over a \SI{150}{pm} range. As the two transmitters become more indistinguishable in wavelength, the number of coincidences reduces close to the theoretical maximum visibility of \SI{50}{\percent}. From the current injection of the on-chip laser, we can see that this level of precision is well within the capability of the chip.

By looking at the total number of counts in each detectors, we can they do not vary with the change in coincidences. This demonstrates that the reduction in coincidences cannot be attributed to classical interference. The difference between the detector counts is due to a slight difference in efficiency between detectors.

\subsection{On-Chip Laser Current Sweep}

\begin{figure}[tp]

	\caption[HOM between fibre components and chip by varying laser current]{To show that the laser control precise enough to vary the wavelength. The total number of counts on each detector was used to vary the attenuation to account for the increasing laser power.}
	\label{fig:fibre_curr_sweep}
\end{figure}

As we have demonstrated that the on-chip laser can show \ac{HOM} interference, we now need show that the wavelength of the laser can be controlled with the precision required.

Using the same experimental setup as in figure \ref{fig:fibre_chip_exp}, we can fix the wavelength of the fibre laser and use the current injection of the integrated laser to tune the wavelength. As the current injection will also vary the photon number per pulse, we used a digital \ac{voa} with feedback from the sum total number of events from both \acp{spd}. 

In figure \ref{fig:fibre_curr_sweep}, we change the wavelength of the chip laser by sweeping the driving current from \SIrange{12}{34}{mA}. As before, we see a reduction in coincidence counts close to the maximum visibility of \SI{50}{\percent} \cite{Rarity2005}. The number of counts in each detector remained constant through the experiment verifying that this is not coherent interference between lasers.

\section{Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference Between Independent Integrated Devices}

\begin{figure}[tp]

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Experiment}

The pulses are coupled into a fibre where \acp{voa} ensure matched intensities and \acp{pc} and \acp{pbs} overlap the polarisation. An optical channel (not shown) synchronises the transmitter and detector electronics.}
	\label{fig:hom_experiment}
\end{figure}

Knowing well that the linewidth and control of the chip laser and modulation could demonstrate interference, the next step would be to demonstrate that two independently controlled devices could show the same interference. 

The experiment uses two \ac{InP} devices which we will call Alice and Bob and a schematic is shown in figure \ref{fig:hom_experiment}. Each chip measures only \SI{6x2}{mm} and contains all the required photonic components to generate the required states to perform \ac{HOM} interference between independent devices. One only need compare the sizes of these optical components to fibre based optics to justify the benefits of integrated devices.

%\subsection{Experimental Setup}

%In this section, we detail the experimental setup used to demonstrate \ac{HOM} interference motivating the design with regards to the requirements set out in the previous section. 

\subsection{HOM Interference}

\begin{figure}[tp]
	\centering
%	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{HOM}
	\def\svgwidth{0.8\textwidth} 
	\import{chapters/chapter03/fig03/}{HOM.pdf_tex}
	\caption[Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between integrated devices]{\ac{HOM} interference between two integrated devices demonstrating \SI{46.5(8)}{\%} visibility. By changing the relative wavelength between the two lasers the lasers become indistinguishable and the number of coincidences reduced to a visibility limited to \SI{50}{\percent}.}
	\label{fig:HOM}
\end{figure}

\acl{HOM} interference was demonstrated between two independent \acp{pic} operating at \SI{431}{\MHz} by varying the relative wavelengths of the lasers. Wavelength was chosen as the distinguishing degree of freedom as all others could be overlapped manually. However, a sweep in timing or polarisation would have seen similar interference provided a good wavelength overlap. 

The two transmitters were initially overlapped in time, polarisation and photon number. Using ps resolution electronic delays in the pulse generation, a histogram from the \acp{spd} allowed a timing overlap between the pulses at the beam splitter. Care was taken to ensure that the pulses that were overlapped on the histogram matched with the pulses that could have interfered on the beam splitter and not a repetition rate or sync window apart. This required calibration of the relative optical and electronic delays after the beam splitter. 

Similarly, the photon number of each pulse was calibrated using a histogram of the pulses relative to one another. This allowed the photon number to be calibrated regardless of the detector efficiency and fibre losses, provided that the beam splitter was balanced. By looking at each transmitter independently an average photon number per pulse was calculated to be $10^{-3}$. The value was chosen to minimise effects from multi-photon terms in the coherent state and to be far away from saturation of the detectors, both of which would have reduced the visibility.

As previously mentioned, current injection into the \ac{SOA} can be used to vary the wavelength with a precision of \SI{80}{\femto\metre}. However, this will also change the power of the laser and increase the number of photons per pulse. Therefore, a digital \ac{voa} was used to vary the attenuation during the sweep based on the sum total of detection events. The assumption was made that the losses (coupling or otherwise) did not vary during the experiment. 

The polarisation of the transmitters was rotated using fibre polarisation controllers which was immediately sent through a \ac{pbs} after which was kept in polarisation maintaining fibre. The beam splitter used polarisation maintaining fibre to ensure that the polarisation did not change after the beam splitter. After the interference, the polarisation maintaining fibre was no longer required as only the time of arrival of photons was important at the detectors.

In figure \ref{fig:HOM}, we demonstrate \acl{HOM} interference between the two devices by sweeping the relative wavelengths of the lasers. From a Gaussian fit we find a visibility of \SI{46.5(8)}{\percent}. We think that it is pertinent to note that during the experiment there was no active feedback to control the polarisation, pulse carving or timing which demonstrates the stability possible with an integrated platform. 

\section{HOM Interference with Actively Phase Randomised Pulses}

\begin{figure}[tp]
	\centering
	\def\svgwidth{0.8\textwidth} 
	\import{chapters/chapter03/fig03/}{gain_switch.pdf_tex}
	\caption[Gain switching of the on-chip lasers at \SI{250}{MHz}]{By applying a negative electrical signal to the on-chip laser, we can drain the optical cavity. Lasing will then resume from spontaneous emission meaning that the phase will not be coherent with the previous lasing conditions. It takes around \SI{1}{\ns} for the laser to relax into a continuous operation from which states can be encoded.}
	\label{fig:gain_switch}
\end{figure}

We have previously discussed that, to demonstrate quantum interference over the classical interference, the laser pulses should be phase randomised relative to one another. In the previous experiment, as the lasers were not phase locked, we could average over the phases by taking data for long enough for the phases between the two lasers to drift. However, for \ac{QKD} purposes this would not meet criteria for security. This means that we need to be able to actively create pulses with randomised phases. This section will describe how we can utilise gain-switching to create phase randomised windows and intensity modulation to create well-defined pulses. Using coincidence counts between neighbouring pulses, we can verify that the  \acp{wcp} are phase randomised.

%As we will see in chapter \ref{chap:mdiqkd}, it will be important for the pulses to be phase randomised relative to subsequent pulses to maintain the security of a \ac{QKD} protocol. 

Laser gain-switching is a technique used to cause phase randomisation by keeping the laser below threshold and only applying current when a \ac{wcp} is desired. As the pulses are limited to the timing of a spontaneous emission, the timing jitter of the pulses is usually large. There is also a wavelength broadening meaning that filtering is required for \ac{HOM} interference \cite{Agnesi2019}. 

Instead of gain switching to generate pulses, we can reverse the high speed pulse to provide a negative voltage between pulse carving. This pulses removes the carriers in the diode and allows the optical cavity to empty to make phase randomised windows. The upper-state lifetime of semiconductors is very short, as is the cavity lifetime, meaning this can still be done relatively quickly. 

In figure \ref{fig:gain_switch}, we demonstrate gain switching the on-chip laser by providing a \SI{-1.5}{V} RF signal. This drains the cavity so that when lasing resumes the phase will come from a spontaneous emission and will be random compared with the previous window. The clock of the \ac{ppg} was set to \SI{2}{GHz} for this experiment, with a pulse being sent by each transmitter every 8 clock cycles. 

After the negative signals, the lasing oscillates before returning to a continuous (and useful) lasing mode. These oscillations can be attributed to mode competition in the laser cavity and also ringing in the RF signal. Therefore, we can still generate states at \SI{250}{MHz} and demonstrate good state preparation through intensity modulation.

To test that the pulses are phase randomised, we can look at coincidences between neighbouring pulses. If the laser is phase randomised, we would not expect to see any relation between subsequent pulses. In figure \ref{fig:HOM_coherence}, we demonstrate two \ac{HOM} fringes with and without phase randomisation. Both experiments see a visibility of \SI{47}{\percent}. When the pulses are coherent, we see a partial relationship between the pulses as the relative wavelength between the lasers changes. If there was complete coherence, this would be a sinusoidal fringe as subsequent pulses tune in and out of phase. After phase randomisation, we find no relationship between coincidences of subsequent pulses.

\begin{figure}[tp]
	\centering

	\def\svgwidth{\textwidth} 
	\import{chapters/chapter03/fig03/}{HOM_coherence.pdf_tex}
	\caption[HOM interference with and without phase randomisation]{\ac{HOM} interference both with and without phase randomisation between pulses. We show the coincidences between pulses that interfered and check the coherence with subsequent pulses. In both cases, we find a fitted visibility of more than \SI{47}{\%} showing that phase randomisation doesn't reduce the fidelity of the states.}
	\label{fig:HOM_coherence}
\end{figure}

We have demonstrated that by combing gain-switching and intensity modulation of an integrated \ac{CW} laser can produce phase randomised \acp{wcp}. The states are capable of \ac{HOM} interference maintaining a comparable visibility to state-of-the-art without requiring any external wavelength filtering.

\section{Outlook}

In this experiment, we have demonstrated state-of-the-art \acl{HOM} interference between GHz clocked integrated photonic devices exploiting monolithically fabricated lasers and \acp{eopm} with a visibility of \SI{46.5(8)}{\%}. Further, we have demonstrated that gain switching the laser between pulses doesn't reduce the visibility. However, this does limit the speed of operation which will be a consideration for \ac{QKD} systems. As we will see in chapter \ref{chap:mdiqkd}, this result will play a crucial role in \ac{MDI} and high fidelity interference will be required to bound the knowledge that could be gained by Mallory.

\subsection{Active Stabilisation}

Performing this experiment in a controlled laboratory environment is obviously favourable for prolonged operation over several hours. However, as the aim will be to create devices that can deployed on real-world networks, the systems will need to compensate for drifts in the fibres and electronic control.

%To maintain a high fidelity interference between the two devices over a prolonged period will require feedback as the devices will drift. 

Polarisation can be stabilised by utilising the unused arm of the \ac{pbs} to monitor counts and using an electrically controlled polarisation controller to keep the polarisation stable.

Wavelength can be stabilised using the visibility of \ac{HOM} interference by minimising coincidences. By changing the current of one of the transmitters, the wavelength can be very finely tuned. While this will change the power of the laser, if only small changes in current are required then this power change will be negligible.

Timing stabilisation can be achieved by looking at the time of arrival of the pulses. In particular, the \ac{FWHM} can be used to ensure that the pulses are overlapped i.e. minimising the \ac{FWHM} in the histogram of detection events means that the pulses will be maximally overlapped.

Given a good current source to dive the laser, the average photon number is unlikely to change dramatically. On-chip fast photodiodes can be used to locally monitor the power to provide any required feedback. Having fibres fixed to the chips with UV cured glue will remove any change of loss from fibre coupling.

%However, using on-chip photodiodes allows local feedback. 
%
%is harder to stabilise but is also the least susceptible to drifts. Having fibres glues onto chips and by using a stable current source to power the laser, it is unlikely that photon number will need often retuning.

\subsection{Wavelength Division Multiplexing}

As mentioned previously, there is no need to filter the pulses to see interference. This is important as it allows the transmitters to be easily wavelength tuned making it compatible with \ac{wdm} and possible classical-quantum multiplexing. An interesting demonstration of this would be to multiplex the quantum signals with classical data to verify that quantum interference can still be seen. This could be an important consideration for future networks.

\subsection{DFB Laser}

The delay caused by the laser relaxation after phase randomisation could be reduced by using a \ac{dfb} laser. \ac{DBR} lasers will take time to relax after gain switching as the cavity will support many modes until a single mode becomes dominant. This behaviour is shown in figure \ref{fig:gain_switch} where the laser oscillates before becoming more stable.
