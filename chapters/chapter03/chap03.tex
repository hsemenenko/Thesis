\label{chap:hom}

Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference is a fundamental tool in any quantum engineering toolbox. It underpins a range of processes ranging from computing to communication. While it is well understood, generating states for quantum interference at the GHz speeds required for modern telecommunication remains practically challenging.

\section{Sources and Requirements}
\label{sec:sources}

Several methods can be conceived to generate weak coherent pulses (WCPs)

\begin{itemize}
	\item Gain switched lasers
	\item Laser seeding
	\item Pulse carving
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Good extinction ratio
	\item Good timing jitter
	\item Narrow linewidth/Long coherence
	\item Phase randomisation
\end{itemize}

\section{Experiment}

In this section, we detail the experimental setup used to demonstrate HOM interference at errors and speeds required to perform state-of-the-art measurement-device-independent QKD (MDI-QKD).

The experiment uses two InP devices which will we label Alice and Bob. Each devices uses a CW laser which is carved into  

Alice (and Bob) uses a stable current sources to drive an on-chip distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) laser which demonstrates a FWHM of $<30$ pm.
