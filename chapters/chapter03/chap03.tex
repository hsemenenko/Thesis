\label{chap:hom}

Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference is a fundamental tool in any quantum engineering toolbox. It underpins a range of processes ranging from computing to communication. While it is well understood, generating states for quantum interference at the GHz speeds required for modern telecommunication remains practically challenging.
