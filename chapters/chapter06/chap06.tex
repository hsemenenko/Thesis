\section{QKD Transmitter Requirements}
\label{sec:sec06}

A \ac{QKD} transmitter will need to meet certain requirements as we have discussed before.

\section{Laser Seeding}

Laser seeding provides a method of generating \ac{QKD} states by overcoming some of the issues with gain switching lasers while also reducing certain electrical requirements.. This has been performed using fibre lasers \cite{}. In this chapter, we will demonstrate the first integrated laser seeding transmitter for time-bin encoding \ac{QKD}. 

\section{Integrated Laser Seeded Transmitter}

There are no circulators or isolators currently available on-chip, so other methods of laser seeding need to be considered.

Figure \ref{fig:hhi_laser_seeding} shows the GDS for the integrated device. The complexity of integrated devices is

	\caption[InP laser seeding transmitter with QRNG]{This shows the layout of the laser seeded transmitter device fabricated by HHI. The chip measures \SI[product-units=power]{6x4}{mm} and contains two laser seeding prototype circuits, a homodyne \ac{qrng} and test structure to measure laser and waveguide performances. This demonstrates the complexity and compactness possible in the integrated platform.}

The electrical connections for integrated devices is challenging, especially in test devices where real estate is valuable. In figure \ref{fig:hhi_pcb} we show a PCB which is required to connect most (but not all) components of the chip.

\section{Results}

The transmitter (shown in figure \ref{fig:hhi_laser_seeding}) contains two methods possible to achieve laser seeding.
