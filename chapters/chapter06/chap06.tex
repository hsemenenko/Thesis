\label{chap:future}

\section*{Statement of Work}

Philip Sibson and I designed the photonic chips and compiled the chip mask that was fabricated by Fraunhofer HHI. I design the PCB for electrical operation and optical connection. I packaged the chip with support from Alasdair Price and Graham Marshall. I performed characterisation of the initial components of the circuits which included laser driving under both DC and RF operation and a preliminary test of laser seeding capability.

\section{Introduction}

Integrated photonics has facilitated a drastic increase in the complexity possible for quantum information experiments \cite{wang2019integrated}. The inherent phase stability allows a level of control on a scale simply not possible with fibre or bulk alternatives. However, the technology is still under heavy development to improve the performances of devices at both component and circuit levels. As such, further optimisation is required before commercial deployment of integrated devices is viable. 

While the demonstrations in previous chapters showed state-of-the-art performances from \ac{InP} devices, there were several parts which are in need of revision. For example, tuning of \acp{mzi} requires \ac{topm} and delay line losses were too high to be used. 

In this chapter, we will introduce the next generation designs for \ac{InP} \ac{QKD} transmitters. By learning from the lessons from the first generation devices, we can introduce more components to the circuit for more fine tuning. Developments in processing have reduced the losses from components and waveguides meaning that optical delay lines become more achievable. Waveguides losses can be as low as \SI{1}{dB\per\cm}

%The transmitters that were used to demonstrate \ac{MDI} could be improved. Here, we will outline the next generation devices that have been designed and fabricated.

\section{Laser Seeding}

Laser seeding provides a method of generating \ac{QKD} states by overcoming some of the issues with gain switching lasers while also reducing certain electrical requirements.. This has been performed using fibre lasers \cite{Comandar2016PLS, Comandar2016}. In this section, we will present two designs for integrated laser seeding transmitter for time-bin encoding \ac{QKD}. Initial characterisation of the devices was performed but further work is required to 

Since this chip had been designed, similar work was published demonstrating an integrated laser-seeding transmitter based on the \ac{InP} platform \cite{paraiso2019}. 

Laser seeing using two pulsed lasers: a master and a slave. Both are driving with electrical square waves. The master laser is kept just below threshold and gain switching causing a laser pulse from a spontaneous emission. The DC offset is such that the timing jitter is minimised (although still large) while maintaining a randomised phase. This initial pulse is sent through a circulator to the slave laser The slave has a DC offset below lasing threshold such that without the master laser pulse, no lasing can occur even with the RF signal.

\subsection{Integrated Laser Seeded Transmitter}

There are no circulators or isolators currently available on-chip, so other methods of laser seeding need to be considered.

Figure \ref{fig:hhi_laser_seeding} shows the GDS for the integrated device. The complexity of integrated devices is obvious. Shared grounded needed to be implemented to reduce the number of electrical wires on the chip.

The chip measures \SI[product-units=power]{6x4}{mm} and contains two laser seeding prototype circuits, a homodyne \ac{qrng} and test structure to measure laser and waveguide performances. This demonstrates the complexity and compactness possible in the integrated platform.}

\end{sidewaysfigure}

The schematic for the on-chip laser seeding test is shown in figure \ref{fig:las_seed_schem} where master and slave lasers can interact.

Back reflections are a potential issue for this design which could introduce challenges achieving phase randomisation.

These are the simplest conceivable circuits to attempted it in an integrated platform}
	\label{fig:las_seed_schem}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Optical and Electrical Packaging}

The complexity of the device required careful consideration to ensure optical and electrical packaging for high-speed operation. This section will describe the design choices to perform the initial tests.

\subsubsection*{PCB Design}

The electrical connections for integrated devices is challenging, especially in test devices where on-chip real estate is valuable. In figure \ref{fig:hhi_pcb} we show the PCB designed to connect most (but not all) components of the chip shown in figure \ref{fig:hhi_laser_seeding}. For this initial test, the \ac{qrng} section of the chip was not connected. In total, 33 electrical lines were included in the design for the initial testing.

The PCB was again made from Rogers 6006 for its high dielectric constant and contained four layers. The first two layers were dedicated to the RF tracks. The top layer provided signal lines through \ac{cpw} while the second layer provided isolation from the DC tracks below. The \ac{cpw} dimensions can be calculated using equations presented in chapter \ref{chap:hom}. The high dielectric constant allowed narrow \acp{cpw} while maintaining a \SI{50}{\ohm} impedance. 

To improve the performance over previous designs, a via fence was included along the RF tracks to create a \ac{gcpw} which should increase the bandwidth \cite{haydl2002use}. This via fence reflects the signal and stops a surface wave being created along the track. The spacing between the vias is important to maximise bandwidth, as is the spacing between the track and via. Generally speaking, a microwaves will reflect off of gaps which are less than \nicefrac{1}{4} of their wavelength \cite{Sain2016}. Therefore, the spacing between each via can be calculated as 

\begin{equation}
	S_\text{via} = \frac{\lambda}{4} = \frac{c}{4 f \sqrt{E_r}}
\end{equation}
where $f$ is the maximum frequency of operation and $E_r$ is the dielectric constant of the substrate. For this PCB design, the vias were placed \SI{500}{\um} from the track and spaced \SI{1}{\mm} apart meaning the \ac{gcpw} should have a bandwidth up to \SI{25}{GHz}. SMA edge-launch connectors rated to \SI{26.5}{GHz} were soldered to the tracks and grounds for high speed signals.

\begin{figure}[tbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{HHI_PCB/HHI_PCB_render_2.png}
	\caption[PCB breakout for an InP integrated circuit]{PCB designed to connect the HHI device to control and measurement equipment. The chip sits in the middle of the PCB so that RF track length can be minimised. RF lines are shielded to increase bandwith and are connected to edge-launch SMA connectors. DC lines are routed through a lower layer of the PCB and connected to an FFC receptacle. A section of the PCB is milled out to allow a \ac{vga} to be mounted for optical connection. Screw holes allow the package to be mounted to a heat sink for thermal management.}
	\label{fig:hhi_pcb}
\end{figure}

The DC tracks were routed through the third and fourth layers of the PCB. To save space on the top layer of the PCB, the bond pads for the DC connections were capped vias that had been previously plated and plugged. This allow the connections to be immediately routed to a lower layer. These were then routed to an FFC connector on the side of the PCB.

The chip contains a PIN \ac{pd} for test purposes. To isolate this from the rest of the circuit, a separate ground was created so that it could be tested separately from the remained of the circuit. A \ac{gcpw} was used to connect this where both ground pads on the chip could be connected to the grounds of the G-S-G line.

%Due to the number of connections required for the chip, DC connections near the chip were routed through plated and capped vias. These were then routed to an FFC connector. 

The chip was placed in the center of the PCB and the side was curved to minimise the RF track lengths required. This section of the PCB was partial milled out the width, length and thickness of the chip so that the top of the chip would be flush with the top of the PCB. This makes wirebonding the chip easier and allows wirebond length to be minimised. This section was plated for thermal conductivity and plated vias added to the bottom of the PCB for thermal management and temperature stabilisation. 

As in the previous chips, the \acp{ssc} were angled at \SI{7}{\degree} from the edge of the chip. This is to reduce the back reflections into the chip. To increase the coupling from the chip to the \ac{vga}, the chip was rotated by \SI{7}{\degree} in the PCB design. The \ac{vga} could then be polished at a \SI{7}{\degree} in the opposite direction and be aligned parallel to the PCB. Unfortunately, the geometry of this design was not fully considered meaning that once rotated, the \ac{vga} was no longer \SI{500}{\um} \textit{vertically} spaced. This is shown in figure \ref{fig:geometry_lesson}. When the first fibre is aligned to the chip, the subsequent fibres no longer line up with the chip facets. Future designs should consider this in the compilation of the chip mask. By adjusting the spacing between \acp{ssc} on the chip, a standard polished \ac{vga} can be used to connect all the optical ports. Alternatively, one can sacrifice coupling efficiency by leaving the chip parallel with the chip and using a standard flat-faced \ac{vga}.

%The chip was angled at \SI{7}{\degree} so that the \acp{ssc} were perpendicular to the side of the PCB. Unfortunately, as shown in figure \ref{fig:geometry_lesson}, this meant that the \ac{vga} no longer lined up with the output ports of the chip. 

One should also note that \SI{7}{\degree} is not the optimal angle for coupling from the chip to the \ac{vga}. The refractive index of the \ac{InP} waveguides is 3.26 whereas standard optical fibre has a refractive index of around 1.44. Therefore, through Snell's law, the optimal angle for coupling from an \ac{ssc} to fibre would be \SI{16}{\degree}. 

A section at the edge of the chip was milled out to provide a space for the \ac{vga} to be held and glued onto the chip. The cutout was designed to allow the chip to hang over the side by about \SI{1}{\mm} to ease gluing. A section at the edge of the PCB was also partially milled out to a depth of around \SI{0.5}{\mm}. This was to allow the bare fibres to remain horizontal and not change the pitch of the \ac{vga} when aligned to the chip. It also provides a place for the fibres to be fixed to the PCB for strain relief.

Solder pads were placed as close to the chip as possible for a thermistor to be used for thermal stabilisation. Tracks were routed to the bottom of the PCB to provide good thermal connectivity to the chip and peltier. Screw holes were provided to allow the device to be connected to a heat sink and were surrounded by vias to shield the PCB from RF radiation.

\begin{figure}[t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{geometry_lesson.pdf}
	\caption[A quick lesson in geometry for edge coupling]{The chip facets are designed as \SI{500}{\um} spaced so as to be compatible with standard \acp{vga}. As previously mentioned, the facets are at a \SI{7}{\degree} angle to the edge of the chip to reduce back reflections into the chip. To maximise coupling, the \ac{vga} chosen was polished to match this angle. However, once rotated, the vertical spacing of the fibres in the \ac{vga} are no longer \SI{500}{\um} spaced. this meant only one fibre could be connected to the device.}
	\label{fig:geometry_lesson}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Chip Mounting}

Unlike the device from Oclaro, where the bottom of the device was the ground plane, there is no need to electrically connect the bottom of the devices from HHI. However, silver epoxy was still used for its good thermal conductivity to aid with temperature stabilising the devices. A section of the PCB was partially milled out meaning that placing the chip was more challenging as the sides of the chip would be below the top of the PCB.

To accurately place the chip onto the PCB, vacuum tweezers were used. A silicone cup was used to pick up the chip from the top. Silver epoxy was spread onto the milled out section where the chip was then placed. The PCB was then heated to around \SI{100}{\celsius} for \SI{30}{\minute}.

%A section for the chip was milled out so that the top of the device would sit flush with the top of the PCB. The was to ease wirebonding and minimise the distance between chip and PCB bond bads. This milled out section was plated and contained four plated vias to the bottom layer of the PCB. This was to bypass the thermal isolation of the substrate and provide a good thermal contact between the chip and the peltier that will be used for thermal management.

\subsubsection*{Wirebonding}



\subsubsection*{Optical Connection}

The \ac{vga} was held using a vacuum chuck and moved using a 6-axis micro-positioner (NanoMax). The on-chip lasers provided a light source for alignment. 

UV cured index matched glue was used to attach the \ac{vga} to the chip. The make and model was Dymax OP-4-20632.

The \ac{vga} was aligned using the on-chip laser. Then a small amount of glue could be applied along the connection. The \ac{vga} was then pressed against the chip. A UV LED lamp illuminated the area to allow for drying. This was left for 12 hours to cure. Silicon was applied to the fibres 

A photograph of the packaged chip under the steriliser is shown in figure \ref{fig:hhi_photo}. The fibre strain relief is shown in the left with silicone to secure the fibre to the PCB.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Laser Operation}

A current sweep of the laser \ac{SOA} was performed to see threshold and power characteristics. Two different lasers were tested on chip with \num{300} and \SI{500}{\um} \ac{SOA} lengths to see the different in performance. The rear \ac{DBR} and phase modulator were \SI{300}{\um} and \SI{50}{\um}, respectively, for both lasers. However, the front \ac{DBR} was only \SI{50}{\um} for the \SI{500}{\um} laser, while the other was \SI{150}{\um}.

The sweeps are show in figure \ref{fig:hhi_soa_sweep}. Both lasers show a lasing threshold of around \SI{30}{\mA}. Fluctuations in power at higher driving current is likely attributed to mode competition. At very high currents, the \SI{300}{\um} \ac{SOA} laser starts to decrease in power. This will be due to the efficiency of the laser diode at higher temperatures.

\begin{figure}[tp]

	\caption[Current sweep of HHI laser SOA]{Sweeping laser current. Threshold of \SI{30}{\mA} for both. Fluctuations in power likely due to the mode competition in the cavity. Reduction in power for \SI{300}{mA} attributed to heating of the diode reducing efficiency.}
	\label{fig:hhi_soa_sweep}
\end{figure}

Laser spectrum shows multi-modal operation. This is likely due to broad reflection peaks in wavelength allowing simultaneous modes in the cavity. Sidebands can be suppressed through current injection of the tunable \acp{DBR}. However, they are still only around \SIrange{30}{40}{dB} below the peak. 

\begin{figure}[tp]
	\centering
	\small	
	\def\svgwidth{0.9\textwidth} 
	\import{chapters/chapter06/fig06/Spectra/}{spectra.pdf_tex}
	\caption[Wavelength sweep through current injection of tunable DBRs]{Current injection of the tunable \acp{DBR} causing a change of peak reflected wavelength. The lasers show multi-modal operation and a sideband suppression of only \SI{35}{dB}.}
	\label{fig:hhi_dbr_sweep}
\end{figure}

The wavelength can be tuned but around \SI{3}{nm} by current injection of the tunable \acp{DBR}. Typical values are less than \SI{2}{V}. High driving current can cause heating of the cavity causing the wavelength to increase. 

The transmitter (shown in figure \ref{fig:hhi_laser_seeding}) contains two methods possible to achieve laser seeding.

\subsection{Gain Switching}

We can characterise the on-chip laser ability to gain switch, which is important for phase randomisation in \ac{QKD}. 

\begin{figure}[tp]

	\small

\end{figure}

\subsection{Laser Seeding}

	\import{chapters/chapter06/fig06/}{laser_seeding_test.pdf_tex}
	\caption[Integrated laser seeding test]{By applying \SI{1}{GHz} square waves to both lasers, we can get pulses that should be phase randomised. However,  this will need testing. Pulses show \SI{120}{ps} \ac{FWHM}.}
	\label{fig:las_seed_test}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Quantum Random Number Generation}

\begin{figure}[t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{schematics/qrng.pdf}
	\caption[Schematic for InP quantum random number generation]{Schematic for the \ac{qrng} using on-chip laser sources and fast \ac{pd} for homodyne measurement. Loss compensation \acp{mzi} allow the lasers to be tuned in power and an \ac{mzi} acts as a beam splitter with a tunable splitting ratio.}
\end{figure}

Random numbers are required for many parts of \ac{QKD}. One way of generating this randomness is with \acp{qrng} which has been demonstrated on \ac{InP} \cite{FrancescoThesis,Abellan2016}. However, there has not yet been a single device which fulfils both the requirements for quantum random number generation \textit{and} quantum key generation.

The chip shown in figure \ref{fig:hhi_laser_seeding} contains both a \ac{qrng} and a laser seeded \ac{QKD} transmitter. Together with electronics to directly read the randomness and generate \ac{QKD} states this could been a fully packaged system.

\section{Improved Transmitters}

There are many ways of improving the \ac{QKD} transmitters. For example, encoding in time-bin using a delay line to separate the pulses or generating different states using independent lasers.

\begin{sidewaysfigure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{QKD_transmitter}
	\caption[Latest generation InP QKD Transmitter]{Latest generation HHI indium phosphide transmitter. The \SI[product-units=power]{6x4}{mm} chip contains a few ways to create BB84 states for QKD. Firstly, we have designs to compare \ac{dfb} and \ac{DBR} lasers. Secondly, we can use a delay line to separate the time bins. Finally, we have multiplexed lasers to pulse independently lasers for each state.}
	\label{fig:hhi_gds}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

\subsubsection*{Multiple Laser Sources}

\begin{figure}[t]
	\centering
	\def\svgwidth{\textwidth}
	\import{chapters/chapter06/fig06/schematics/}{gain_switch_transmitter.pdf_tex}
		\caption[Schematic of the multiple laser source transmitter]{Schematic of the multiple laser source transmitter. By using independent lasers to generate each of the different states, we can gain switch each to ensure phase incoherence between them. A relatively simple optical circuit can then be used to encode the four BB84 states in time-bins. The loss compensation \ac{mzi} can match the losses between the two paths in the \ac{amzi}. The phase compensation allows fine tuning of the relative phases in the X basis states.}
	\label{fig:multiple_lasers_tx}
\end{figure}

We introduce multiple laser sources into the circuit which can each be independently gain-switched to generate the four BB84 states. 

From chapter \ref{chap:hom}, we can see that laser wavelengths can be overlapped very precisely. Therefore, introducing multiple laser sources shouldn't introduce any side-channels for Eve or Mallory to exploit.

The top laser is pulsed to give a $\ket{0}$ state as it will go through the delay line and end up as a late pulses. The bottom laser will go through the short arm of the \ac{amzi} and will make a $\ket{1}$ state.

For the X basis states, the different paths will cause a relative phase to be introduced.

$\ket{+}$:

\begin{equation}
	a^\dagger_e \xrightarrow{\text{BS}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (a^\dagger_e + b^\dagger_e) \xrightarrow{\text{aMZI}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (a^\dagger_l + b^\dagger_e) \xrightarrow{\text{BS}} \frac{1}{2}(a^\dagger_e + a^\dagger_l - b^\dagger_e + b^\dagger_l)
\end{equation}

$\ket{-}$:

\begin{equation}
	b^\dagger_e \xrightarrow{\text{BS}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (a^\dagger_e - b^\dagger_e) \xrightarrow{\text{aMZI}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (a^\dagger_l - b^\dagger_e) \xrightarrow{\text{BS}} \frac{1}{2}(- a^\dagger_e + a^\dagger_l + b^\dagger_e + b^\dagger_l)
\end{equation}

So when looking at the output port, we get a relative phase between the two different pulsed lasers.

\subsubsection*{Delay Line Time-Bin Encoding}

\begin{sidewaysfigure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./schematics/hhi_transmitter.pdf}
	\caption[Schematic of the HHI full transmitter]{Schematic of the HHI transmitter}
	\label{fig:hhi_transmitter}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

While the previous generation of devices included delay lines to encode timing information, they we too lossy to be used. We have included a delay line in the design of this chip which should have lower losses. This should reduce the complexity of the control electronics and make the system compatible with a gain-switched DFB laser.

\section{Outlook}

This chapter has extended the use of integrated devices for \acl{QKD}.
