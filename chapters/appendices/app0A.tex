	\item Ask forgiveness, not permission
	\item Remember that you will forget things
	\item Always make figures on a white background
	\item Timelines are useful to give you perspective
	\item It is impossible to keep to a timeline
	\item Work out how long you think something will take, and then multiple by 10 \cite{Hofstadter}
	\item Be nice to the admin team, they know where your supervisor is
	\item Long days $\ne$ productivity
	\item Coffee is your friend
	\item No one else has a clue what they're talking about either
	\item You will make stupid mistakes
	\item Equipment will break
	\item Where a paper is published has no relation to its quality of work 
	\item If someone on Stack Overflow hasn't solved your problem, you're probably in too deep
	\item Learn \LaTeX{} and never look back
	\item Aesthetics are almost as important as content
	\item Remember to take a holiday

	\item Backup your data
	\item Most meetings are optional

	\item Only be sassy in person, don't leave written evidence
	\item If you leave something until the last minute it only takes a minute
	\item Give your files sensible names
	\item Don't rely on collaborators
	\item If it's important it's worth a second email
	\item Your supervisor isn't always right
	\item If it is stupid but it works, it isn't stupid
	\item Don't fix what ain't broke
	\item Don't update software unless you have to
	\item Publications don't fairly represent the number of failed attempts
	\item Try not to be over ambitious i.e. 100 is a big number
	\item Don't ask questions that are ``more of a comment, really''
	\item The poster title \textit{is} the abstract
	\item Everything not saved will be lost - Nintendo "Quit Screen"
