	\item Ask forgiveness, not permission
	\item Remember that you will forget things
	\item Always make figures on a white background
	\item Timelines are useful to give you perspective
	\item It is impossible to keep to a timeline

	\item You will make stupid mistakes
	\item Equipment will break
	\item Where a paper is published has no relation to its quality of work 
	\item If someone on Stack Overflow hasn't solved your problem, you're probably in too deep
	\item Learn \LaTeX{} and never look back
	\item The complexity of coding \LaTeX{} is inversely proportional to how long you expect it to take

	\item Most meetings are optional

	\item Give your files sensible names
	\item Don't rely on collaborators

	\item Everything not saved will be lost - Nintendo "Quit Screen"
	\item Dolly Parton didn't specify \textit{which} 9 to 5 i.e. working hours are flexible
	\item The best way to find a typo is to click submit
	\item Your family won't understand what your PhD is about no matter how many times you try
	\item Finish first, perfect later
