As with any work of research, it is built upon centuries of previous work. Here we highlight some important advances which will be required for the rest of the thesis.

\section{Cryptography}
\label{sec1:crypto}

Cryptography is the process of taking a message ({\color{bristol-red} plaintext}) and translating it into a {\color{bristol-red} ciphertext}. Importantly, it also encompasses the reverse process of taking a ciphertext and returning the original message. The idea of obscuring messages from third-party onlookers dates back (as far as we can tell) to ancient Egypt and has played an important role in the world for the last 2 millennia. 

The convenience of being able to share thoughts through written methods came with an immediate compromise to security.

\subsection{Symmetric Key Cryptography}

Two parties, typically Alice and Bob, share a secret key that can be used to encrypt messages. The method of encryption is, generally, publicly known. However, it will be hard to decrypt messages without the secret key.

These ciphers have been widely used through history. However, with modern technology, they are not deemed to be secure. We will see in section \ref{sec1:cryptanalysis}

\subsection{Monoalphabetic Ciphers}

The simplest ciphers are those that permute the alphabet and are known as {\color{bristol-red} monoalphabetic ciphers}. The symmetric key in these ciphers is the permutation used. There are two well known cases of monoalphabetic ciphers which we will present here. 

\subsubsection*{Caesar Cipher}

The Caesar cipher one of the oldest that was well documented being used. Seutonius wrote that Julius Caesar used the cipher to send important information to the military. 

By assigning values to each letter of the alphabet (`a' = 0, `b' = 1, etc.), the encryption is done by `adding' the secret key, $k$ to each letter modulo 26. For example, when $k = 5$ we get the encoding

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l l}%{@{}l@{\ }l}
	Plain:  &\quad{\tt a b c \ldots x y z} \\ 
	Cipher: &\quad{\tt F G H \ldots C D E} \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Deciphering the ciphertext is as simple as `subtracting' $k$ from each letter and reading out the plaintext message.

As there are only 25 possibly keys, a brute force attack on this kind of cipher is fairly trivial. It is easy to loop over each choice, especially with modern computers, until the plaintext is revealed.

\subsubsection*{Affine Cipher}

A slightly more complex cipher is the affine cipher. This is still a mapping from the alphabet to itself (i.e. monoalphabetic) but the key now contains two numbers. Firstly

\subsection{Polyalphabetic Ciphers}



\subsubsection*{Vigen\`{e}re Cipher}

This cipher was developed by Giovan Battista Bellaso in 1553 \cite{} but is attributed to Blaise de Vigen\`{e}re \cite{}. The key is a word or phrase which can be `added' to the plaintext to get the cipher text.

\subsubsection*{One-Time Pad}

A polyalphabetic cipher where the key is as long as the message. If the key is truly random, each message is equally likely given a cipher text. Therefore, it is unbreakable provided that the key is completely secure.

The problems then becomes how to distribute the keys.

\subsection{Block Ciphers}

\Ac{aes} is, by far, the most used encryption method used today. It is generally thought that \ac{aes} is secure against attacks by a quantum computer. However, much like security using classical computers, there is no proof.

\subsection{Public Key Cryptography}

A more practical method of encrypting data is to

This is the research into how encryption can be broken.

\subsection{Hacking}

While \ac{QKD} is often claimed to be ``perfectly secure'' or ``unhackable'', this is only true under certain assumptions. 

There have been numerous demonstrations that \ac{QKD} system are insecure under real world condition.

\subsubsection*{Device Independence}

To remove potential attacks on \ac{QKD} systems, protocols have been developed to relieve some of the assumptions required for security in a key exchange. 

Creating accurate models for equipment is particularly challenging. By removing assumptions about their operation, full characterisation is no longer required.
