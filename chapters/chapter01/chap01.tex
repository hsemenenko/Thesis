The outline of the thesis is as follows. Chapter \ref{chap:background} will introduce some of the necessary background work and concepts that will be used throughout the rest of the thesis. The experimental work will start with Chapter \ref{chap:hom} by introducing \ac{HOM} interference using integrated devices. Chapters \ref{chap:mdiqk} and \ref{chap:node} will build on this work to present a demonstration of \ac{MDI} using integrated devices. Finally, Chapter \ref{chap:laser-seeding} will show work towards new \ac{QKD} transmitters before we conclude in Chapter \ref{chap:conclusion}.
