abstract = {Quantum key distribution (QKD), harnessing quantum physics and optoelectronics, may promise unconditionally secure information exchange in theory. Recently, theoretical and experimental advances in measurement-device-independent (MDI)-QKD have successfully closed the physical back door in detection terminals. However, the issues of scalability, stability, cost and loss prevent QKD systems from widespread application in practice. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a solution to build a star-topology quantum access network with an integrated server. By using femtosecond laser direct writing techniques, we construct integrated circuits for all the elements of Bell state analyzer together and are able to integrate 10 such analyzer structures on a single photonic chip. The measured high-visibility Bell state analysis suggests the integrated server as a promising platform for the practical application of MDI-QKD network.},

It uses monolithic integration of all photonic functions in the InP layers to leverage the most efficient optoelectronic processes and to remove optical interfaces between separately grown wafers. Using an optoelectronic material for the photonic components provides a powerful route to nanoscale miniaturization and circuit-level performance enhancements. In this chapter, we review the progress in the passive and active InP building blocks and highlight routes to miniaturization and performance scaling. We address the interfaces between building blocks, which are critical to a powerful platform approach. The platform approach enables customization by designers to create new components and circuits. The process design kit methodology is applied to provide a route to circuit design abstraction.",

Silicon photonics in particular is a leading platform for quantum photonic technologies, with further benefits of miniaturization, cost-effective device manufacture, and compatibility with CMOS microelectronics. However, effective techniques for high-speed modulation of quantum states in standard silicon photonic platforms have been limited. Here we overcome this limitation and demonstrate high-speed low-error quantum key distribution modulation with silicon photonic devices combining slow thermo-optic DC biases and fast (10 GHz bandwidth) carrier-depletion modulation. The ability to scale up these integrated circuits and incorporate microelectronics opens the way to new and advanced integrated quantum communication technologies and larger adoption of quantum-secured communications.},

abstract = {The versatility of silicon photonic integrated circuits has led to a widespread usage of this platform for quantum information-based applications, including quantum key distribution (QKD). However, the integration of simple high-repetition-rate photon sources is yet to be achieved. The use of weak-coherent pulses (WCPs) could represent a viable solution. For example, measurement device independent QKD (MDI-QKD) envisions the use of WCPs to distill a secret key immune to detector side channel attacks at large distances. Thus, the integration of III--V lasers on silicon waveguides is an interesting prospect for quantum photonics. Here we report the experimental observation of Hong--Ou--Mandel interference with 46{\textpm}2\% visibility between WCPs generated by two independent III--V on silicon waveguide integrated lasers. This quantum interference effect is at the heart of many applications, including MDI-QKD. This Letter represents a substantial first step towards an implementation of MDI-QKD fully integrated in silicon and could be beneficial for other applications such as standard QKD and novel quantum communication protocols.},

The quality of random numbers ultimately determines the security and privacy that can be achieved, while the speed at which they can be generated poses limits to the utilization of the available resources. In this work we propose and demonstrate a quantum entropy source for random number generation on an indium phosphide photonic integrated circuit made possible by a new design using two-laser interference and heterodyne detection. The resulting device offers high-speed operation with unprecedented security guarantees and reduced form factor. It is also compatible with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology, opening the path to its integration in computation and communication electronic cards, which is particularly relevant for the intensive migration of information processing and storage tasks from local premises to cloud data centers.},
