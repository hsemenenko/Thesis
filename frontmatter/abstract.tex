To consider information as a quantum system offers many advantages in computation, sensing and communication. 

Upholding the security of communication is of vital importance if we want to maintain the integrity of the national infrastructure that supports modern society.

Technology founded in quantum phenomena is set to revolutionise computation, sensing and communication. With an entirely different method of encoding information, quantum computers are able to offer significant advances when compared to their classical counterparts. Unrelenting research through the world imply that such machines are set to be the demise of the public-key cryptography that is critical to modern society.

\Ac{QKD} offers a method to security distribute randomness between distant parties using fundamental properties of the world to guarantee secrecy. The unique nature of the protocol allows eavesdropper detection. The security of the key does not decrease as computing power increases. However, \ac{QKD} systems have been susceptible to information leakage or hacks which compromises their security. 

New methods are required to ensure that the \ac{QKD} systems match their 

Leverage the knowledge from microelectronics, integrated optics provides a platform for scalable quantum information processing. 

In this thesis, we will extend the functionality of integrated devices.

ensuring that security based on quantum physics is practical and accessible.
